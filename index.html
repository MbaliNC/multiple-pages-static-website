    <a href="/about.html">About Me</a>
    <p>
        Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup dish that's widely popular in Japan and throughout the world. Though there are
        thousands
        of variations, the dish consists of a broth base, long thin noodles made from wheat, and an assortment of
        toppings.
        It is believed that ramen noodles originated in China and were eventually introduced to Japan. But ramen is a
        common and
        popular dish in Japanese diets and throughout all of Asia. Japan has a large selection of dried, pre-packaged
        ramen
        containers ready to be boiled and seasoned. But fresh ramen can be found literally everywhere, including tiny
        alleyways
        to ramen restaurants.
